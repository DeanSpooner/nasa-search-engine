# NASA Search Engine by Dean Spooner - [Live here](https://deanspooner.github.io/nasa-search-engine)! ðŸš€

This is a React web application that allows users to search for space-related images using a NASA API endpoint. It was built as a mock technical test as part of the Manchester Codes front-end module.
