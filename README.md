# NASA Search Engine v1.1 by Dean Spooner - [Live here](https://deanspooner.github.io/nasa-search-engine)! ðŸš€

This is a React web application that allows users to search for space-related images using a NASA API endpoint. It was built as a mock technical test as part of the Manchester Codes front-end module.

## Latest updates:

- V1.1: Added a message that displays when a search term returns 0 results, to let the user know the engine has tried to search for them;
- V1.0: Fully working search engine that takes in a term, and lists related space images from NASA.
